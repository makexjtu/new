9static_x.py: slit system, average along x.(Most advanced, equipped with DC calculation.)
9static_z.py:  slit average along z.
9pore_static_z.py: for pslit/pcyl pore, plot CA location and the profiles nearby, not the whole way, along z, i.e. take the z-coordinate value.

9daadiffusion.py: all atom diffusion plot
9dcomdiffusion: com diffusion coefficient from com velocity 
9xvcf.py prints out vacf/vccf contributions, distinguishes all x y z contributions.

Iter2 makes more sense than Iter1. DDC seems more reasonable than NPT.

Long DDC makes sense, short DDC doesn’t.

690 stage4 bulk NVT DCE+IL, D_c=2.258e-10m^2/s D_a = 2.091e-10m^2/s
solvent makes DDC (anti-)/correlation think opposite.
749 stage4 bulk NVT DCE+IL, D=1.312 e-9for cation, D_a =1.297e-0m^2/s for anion 
Cation and anion DDC acting in sync, same pos and neg cycle, SDC not converging well for cation and anion. Furthermore, in 895 slit pos2, cation and anion DDC  are still acting in sync, even for x component only (perpendicular to slit)
